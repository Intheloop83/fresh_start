<h4 style="font-weight: bolder"> COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s insufficient response in providing economic
    relief has led to an
    enormous
    increase in food insecurity in this country. At least 54 million people are facing experiencing food insecurity
    (meaning
    they don’t have access to healthy food), and past research suggests that formerly incarcerated people, and the
    children
    of currently incarcerated people, are at especially high risks.
    Essentially, food insecurity is an often-overlooked consequence of incarceration, and it can’t be separated from
    the
    more well-known
    problems of homelessness and unemployment.</h4>
